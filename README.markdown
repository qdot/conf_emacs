Description
===========

This repository represents the deep, dark recesses of my soul, better known as my emacs configuration files. I've mercilessly ripped the format from Alex Ott's wonderful emacs conf files and tutorials, available at

[http://xtalk.msk.su/~ott/common/emacs/_emacs.html](http://xtalk.msk.su/~ott/common/emacs/_emacs.html)

Any other attributions are usually made in the elisp code itself. 

Everything else is maintained by way of git submodules, so whenever you pull this repository, do at

git submodule --init update

To get the latest submodules. Thanks goes to whoever runs

[http://github.com/emacsmirror](http://github.com/emacsmirror)

For keeping git versions of the cedet and w3m repos

And thanks to Dave Abrahams for maintaining the repos for wanderlust and requirements at
