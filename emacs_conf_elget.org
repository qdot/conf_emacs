* El-get
Sets up variables for storage locations and status files. If el-get
doesn't currently exist on the system, it downloads the initialization
file and tries to install it. After that, it will pull all packages in
the status file. This is useful for rebuilding from scratch in the git
repo, though it can take a really, really, REALLY long time.
